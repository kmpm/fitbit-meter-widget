To work with this example you will need the 32x32 pixel icons from 
https://github.com/Fitbit/sdk-design-assets

I didn't want to add the to the project as they fall under a different kind
of license and INAL so.

You will need...
* stat_am_solid32px.png
* stat_cals_solid_32px.png
* stat_eleveation_32px_p.png
* stat_hr_solid_32px.png
* stat_steps_solid_32px.png
* stat_floors_solid_32px.png

...or change the `index.gui` file.
